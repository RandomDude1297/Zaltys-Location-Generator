# Zaltys-Location-Generator

First of all here is the link to a documentation for Zaltys Locations
https://github.com/valahraban/AID-World-Info-research-sheet/blob/main/AID%20WI%20Research%20Sheet.md#zaltys-locations

Feel free to use or change the code however you want.

It's just something I made for myself so I'm sorry if it doesn't work for your specific device but I probably won't fix it.
If someone else wants to continue this and make it more user friendly go ahead my code is free to take.

I included a zip package with the exe, the jdk and the executable jar and an apk.

The apk should work on phones with a 5.0+ screen (anything smaller will probably have problems)
