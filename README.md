# Zaltys-Location-Generator

First of all here is the link to a documentation for Zaltys Locations

Feel free to use or change the code however you want.

I'm pretty new to coding and this was something I mainly made for myself so I'm sorry if it doesn't work for your specific device but I probably won't fix it (unless it's something easy and not tedious).
If someone else wants to continue this and make it more user friendly go ahead my code is free to take.

The zip package contains the exe, the jdk and the executable jar.

The apk should work on phones with Android 4.1+ and with a 5.0+ screen (anything smaller will probably have problems)
If the text at the bottom of the screen doesn't end with .] then you'll have to mark and select all. Some text got cut off due to your phone being too small.
The app will also warn you that it's from an unknown creator (cause I am unknown) have no clue how to change that yet would check that later.
