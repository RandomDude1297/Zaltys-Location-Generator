# Zaltys-Location-Generator

The apk should work on phones with Android 4.1+ and with a 5.0+ screen (anything smaller will probably have problems)
If the text at the bottom of the screen doesn't end with .] then you'll have to mark and select all. Some text got cut off due to your phone being too small.
The app will also warn you that it's from an unknown creator (cause I am unknown) have no clue how to change that yet would check that later.

I'll add the code, an exe for windows user and a executeable jar tomorrow or Friday
